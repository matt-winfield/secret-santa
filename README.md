# Secret Santa

A secret santa app, that allows the creation of a group and each member is randomly assigned another member to give a gift to.

A unique link is generated for each group, which can be shared with the members of the group to see who they are assigned to.

There is an option to exclude certain members from being assigned to each other - for example, couples.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
